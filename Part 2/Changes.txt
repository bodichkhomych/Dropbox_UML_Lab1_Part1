1. Change the architecture of Project
1.1)To constrain classes: Product, Branch within MyType namespace.
1.2)To constrain classes: Map, HashNode, Hasher within MINE_STL namespace.
1.3)Make HashNode as nested class for Map
1.4)Segregate method declarations and implementations for template classes
1.5)Add another class for function and prime integers generating
1.3)Check whether build is succeeded.

2. Improve hasher class options
2.1) Provide an ability for user to create hash functor for own class.(std::hash<T> style)
2.2) Complement hash function for pointer like types(strings - const char*, arrays - T*, T*)
3.1) Change the idea of hashing due to some infinite loops in HashMap for certain data sets
3.2) Add generating prime integers while creating FuncGenerator

3.Fix errors in HashMap class
3.1) in rehashAll function fix infinite loop while adding element with same key and doing full rehashing
3.2) Add free of memory in destructor

4. Make testing in separate class, namespace, project

5. Additional
5.1) Add dot format printing of hashtable with further GraphViz vizualization.
5.2) Add documentation,comments for public interfaces of class components
